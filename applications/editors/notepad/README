Notepad is simple text editor that uses the OXTextEdit widget. It was
first started by H. Radke, I just sort of finished it.

Still to be done
----------------

- all help stuff


Changes to the last release
---------------------------

- OXTextEdit was rewritten and moved to the xclass library.
- TABs are now handled properly (the default tab width of 8 can be changed
  too).
- Added some shortcuts:

	Ctrl + x                     : cut
	Ctrl + c  or  Ctrl + Insert  : copy
	CTRL + v  or  Shift + Insert : paste
	F3                           : search again Dialog

- Added Help files. F1 now opens the Help window.


Install
-------

You will need xclass 0.9.1 or higher to compile this version of notepad.
To compile and install notepad enter the following commands:

  make
  make install

The last command must be run as superuser. If you do not have root access,
you can install the application locally in your home directory, by typing

  make install_user

instead of 'make install'. That will put the executable in $HOME/.xclass/bin
and the help files in $HOME/.xclass/docs/notepad. You should then to either
add $HOME/.xclass/bin to your $PATH environment variable, or to copy the
notepad executable to a suitable directory.

A pixmap is provided for using with xclass explorer. Copy it to the
directory where the xclass icons reside and append the following lines to
your ~/.xclass/etc/mime.types file:

	[text/plain]
	pattern = *.te?xt 
	icon = mini.text.xpm
	action = notepad %s

For fvwm95, add the following line to the .fvwm95rc file:

	Style "Notepad" TitleIcon mini.text.xpm

There are two more pixmaps: notepad.s.xpm and notepad.t.xpm. Copy them to
your xclass icons directory as well (where OX_POOL points to). After that,
every file box (including explorer) will show those icons for the "notepad"
executable.

Have fun,
