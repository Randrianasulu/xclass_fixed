Notepad is simple text editor that uses the OXTextEdit widget. It was
first started by H. Radke, I just sort of finished it.

Still to be done
----------------

- all help stuff


Changes to the last release
---------------------------

- OXTextEdit was rewritten and moved to the xclass library.
- TABs are now handled properly (the default tab width of 8 can be changed
  too).
- Added some shortcuts:

	Ctrl + x                     : cut
	Ctrl + c  or  Ctrl + Insert  : copy
	CTRL + v  or  Shift + Insert : paste
	F3                           : search again Dialog


Install
-------

Just type "make" and copy the binary to a dir somewhere in your path.

A pixmap is also provided for using with xclass explorer, just modify your
~/.xclass/etc/mime.types file accordingly:

	[text/plain]
	pattern = *.te?xt 
	icon = mini.text.xpm
	action = notepad %s

For fvwm95, just add to the .fvwm95rc file:

	Style "Notepad" TitleIcon mini.text.xpm

There are two more pixmaps: notepad.s.xpm and notepad.t.xpm. Copy those to
your xclass icons directory (where OX_POOL points to) After that, every
file box (including explorer) will show those icons for the "notepad"
executable.

Have fun,
