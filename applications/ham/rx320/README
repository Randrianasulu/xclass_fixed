Intro
-----

This is the alpha version 0.4.2 of rx320, a Linux control program for the
Ten-Tec RX320 receiver with a graphical user interface.

Currently the program is capable of communicating with the receiver using
one of the available serial ports. There is also support for managing
frequency database files: the program can read and save files in Clifton
Turner's *.320 format, and the receiver can be tuned to selected stations.
New stations can be entered and existing ones can be edited.

No frequency sweep modes are implemented yet.

The program saves the whole receiver state on exit, including the two VFO
frequencies, and restores them on startup. The receiver is also reinitialized
every time a power-on is detected.

Right-clicking on an empty space between buttons pops-up a menu which lets
you to open a new frequency database window, access the configuration dialog
or exit the program.

You can have any given number of database windows open simultaneously. To
load a frequency file (*.320 or *.cdf) use the Open option from the File
menu of the database window. Double-click on station names to tune the
receiver into that station. Select "Edit/Add new station" to enter a new
station into the database, "Edit/Change entry" lets you edit the currently
selected database entry.

The main tuning knob works more like a real one (i.e. you click on the small
hole and move the mouse around in circles), and not like the knob in the
Ten-Tec's Windows program. If you have a wheel mouse supported by your X
server, then you can use the wheel to tune up and down with the selected
step, or ten times the step value if you hold Shift down (note that for this
to work the mouse pointer must be located somewhere over the main window).

You can also use the Right and Left arrow keys on your keyboard to tune up
and down in frequency with the currently selected tuning step, or PgUp and
PgDn to tune by 10 times the current step. Use the number keys to enter
directly a frequency (in Hertz), finish with Enter to tune to that
frequency or with Escape to abort the operation.

The Up and Down arrow keys can be used to increase/decrease the speaker
volume, or the line-out volume if you hold the Shift key down.


Installation
------------

To compile and run the program you need to have xclass version 0.6.4 or
higher installed in your system (xclass is currently available from
http://xclass.sourceforge.net and ftp://mitac11.uia.ac.be/pub/xclass).
In order to build the executable go to the directory where you unpacked
the sources and type 'make'. Then copy the resulting rx320 to somewhere
in your $PATH.

To run the program, just type rx320 and the main window should appear. The
serial port device initially defaults to /dev/ttyS1, and if you're using
another port you'll have to use the configuration dialog (accessible from
the popup menu as described above) to enter the new device name. Make sure
you have the correct permissions to access the serial port.


Have fun,
Hector.
