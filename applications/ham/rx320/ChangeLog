30/08/01

- Preliminary version. Got the communication working.


31/08/01

- Added main panel, S meter.


01/09/01

- Changed the frequency calculations: use long integers instead of floating
  point values in order to avoid rounding problems.


02/09/01

- Implemented tuning knob.

- Added a few keyboard shortcuts.


11/11/01 (0.1)

- The serial port is no longer fixed to /dev/ttyS1, although the settings
  have to be changed manually by editing the rx320rc file.

- Released first alpha version.


12/11/01 (0.2)

- Added passband tuning (thanks to Tom Lackamp).

- Added OFreqRecord class to handle frequency records in Clifton Turner's
  *.320 Frequency File Format.


25/11/01

- Added Frequency Database viewer.

- Added Station edit dialog.

- Added support (experimental) for reading *.cdf files.


28/11/01 (0.3)

- Added toolbar buttons for add, edit and delete stations.


3/06/02 (0.4)

- Added (preliminary) setup dialog, the serial port now can be changed by
  this dialog.

- Serial port connection error messages are now shown in message boxes.


7/06/02 (0.4.1)

- Corrected a bug in the frequency database viewer that caused the
  application to crash when enter was presed in order to tune to the
  selected station.


28/07/02 (0.4.2)

- Avoid displaying multiple message boxes if the user keeps pressing the
  close button and the file is not saved.

- Each database window now keeps the full path to loaded filename.
  Previously other database instances could change the current dir, and
  the file would get saved in a different directory.

- Added wheel mouse support.

- Up/Down keys can be used now to control the volume.


16/05/03 (0.4.3)

- std namespace explicitely used when referencing C++ vector objects
  (required by latest STL/g++ versions).


7/07/03 (0.4.4)

- Fixed the frequency database menu item problem.


15/07/03 (0.4.5)

- Reversed the action of the PBT slider: moving it up now shifts the
  passband up, the range was also expanded to +/-2000 Hz.

- Corrected PBT problem: the offset value was not being saved in vfo
  structure.


17/07/03

- Corrected an obscure bug in DoOpen().


27/06/04 (0.5.1)

- Added keyboard shortcuts for selecting AM/LSB/USB/CW modes, and for
  toggling mute.

- Added help support and help files (requires xclass 0.8.4)


29/06/04

- Added preliminary scan window.


30/06/04

- Added BFO slider. PBT offset no longer doubles as CW offset in CW mode.

- Corrected a problem in tuning routine in CW mode: the selected filter was
  not centered on the signal. CW reception is much better now.

- OXSMeter: use buffer pixmap.

- The application now sets the WM size hints.


01/07/04

- Added more functionality to OXBandScope and OXScanWindow. Scan already
  works, although is not fully functional yet.


03/07/04  (0.6.1)

- Added a queueing and redundant-command discard mechanism to ORX320 that
  very effectively reduces the characteristic "rubber-band" delay effect
  produced by the limited RX320 serial transfer speed capabilities. The
  effect was very noticeable while quickly tuning over a band, or by quickly
  operating the sliders.

- When entering a frequency manually from the keyboard, check that the
  entered value is in range.

- Allow zero as the lowest frequency.

- Added a slide-ruler dial.

- Added band info.


04/07/04

- Re-arranged scan window controls, added the grid labels and status info.

- Added line/bars styles to the band scope display.

- Scan settings are now saved into the ini file.

- Moved the About dialog box to OXMain.

- Added keyboard shortcuts for the <+> and <-> keys. These now change the
  current tuning step.

- Updated the help files.

- Added installing of help files to Makefile. Also added a 'install_user'
  target for local home-directory installation.
