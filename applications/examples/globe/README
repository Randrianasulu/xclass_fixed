This is yet another xclass example program. It displays an earth globe
using 3D vector graphics. The globle can be turned around and zoomed
in/out. 

In order to compile it, copy the files to the xclass/clients tree, edit
the Makefile if necessary, then do a 'make'.

The program uses these keyboard shortcuts:

arrows - rotate globe
i - zoom in
o - zoom out
g - toggle grid
q - quit

The data for continents, as well as code ideas, was taken and converted to
a C format from a public domain OPL program for Psion-3a series of
hand-held computers written by Andras Cserhati <cserhati@tea.npp.hu>. 

I just wanted to see how it looked with xclass ;-) 

Hope you enjoy it,
Hector.
