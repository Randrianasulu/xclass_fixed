Here you will find some programs used to test the different
widgets and features of the xclass library.

wintest  - used to test the dialog and message boxes, as
           well as the following widgets:
             - menu bar and popup menus
             - scrollable canvas
             - buttons
             - tab
             - sliders
             - text entries

ftest    - used to test timers and file event handlers, just open
           a big file (try the unstripped libxclass.a one) and
           watch the count of bytes read fly. The interface keeps 
           operational and the clock keeps updating the time during
           the read operation. To cancel the file access, do a
           File/Open again and answer 'yes' to the message box.

           return everytime the last top-level window is closed.
