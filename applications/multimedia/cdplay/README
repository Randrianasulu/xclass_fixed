Here is the first alpha version of the CDPlayer.

To eject a disk, push the eject button ON THE CDPLAYER WINDOW. Please
don't try to change cd without doin that.

A hundred features missing and a few bugs I'm currently fixing.

The icons must be moved into the xclass icons directory.

BUGS :
- Display during skip forward/backward. Kinda fixed today ( 970701 ) but
  I must test the beast.

TODO :
- The random playing feature.
- Lots of things including xmcd database things.
