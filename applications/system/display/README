Description
-----------

This application enables you to change the visual settings of the desktop
and xclass applications such as color, fonts, etc. It is intended to be used
as a companion to the desktop and explorer applications.


Limitations
-----------

- Changes in font settings are not dynamically processed by xclass
  applications at this stage (xclass 0.6.2). Likewise, not all widgets are
  capable of changing their visual attributes on the fly.
  
- The color of window decorations (window borders, buttons, etc) is not
  changed, unless you're running fvwm95 and the application is started as a
  fvwm95 module.

- Due to current fvwm95 limitations, a Recapture command has to be issued
  after applying color changes that causes a lot of flashing.


Compilation
-----------

You must have xclass version 0.6.2 or higher installed. To complie the
application just do a "make".


Enjoy!
Hector.
