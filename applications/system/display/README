Description
-----------

This application enables you to change the visual settings of the desktop
and xclass applications such as color, fonts, etc. It is intended to be used
as a companion to the desktop and explorer applications.


Usage
-----

This application is intended to be used as a fvwm95 module (for best results
use fvwm95-2.0.43d), and as a such it should be started by an appropiate
command in the .fvwm95rc file, for example:

 AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "Xclass settings" Module /usr/local/bin/display

The application can be started also directly from the command line in
"standalone" mode. In that case, no communication with the window manager
is possible, and settings like window decoration colors cannot be changed.

When started, a "Display properties" dialog will appear. Currently, only the
"Appearance" tab is implemented (and only partially). Select the desired
item from the corresponding drop-down box, use the color select controls to
change colors, then click "Apply".


Limitations
-----------

- Changes in font settings are not dynamically processed by xclass
  applications at this stage (xclass 0.6.2). Likewise, not all widgets are
  capable of changing their visual attributes on the fly yet.

- The color of window decorations (window borders, buttons, etc) is not
  changed, unless you're running fvwm95 and the application is started as a
  fvwm95 module.

- Due to current fvwm95 limitations, a Recapture command has to be issued
  after applying color changes that causes a lot of flashing.


Compilation
-----------

You must have xclass version 0.6.2 or higher installed. To complie the
application just do a "make".


Enjoy!
Hector.
