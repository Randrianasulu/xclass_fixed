Intro
-----

This is a mail check plugin for the taskbar. It displays an status icon in
the tray window showing the current mailbox status. The plugin can also
execute an arbitrary fvwm95 command upon arrival of new mail, or in response
to a click and/or double-click actions.

If you have access to several mail boxes on the same machine, you may run
several copies of the mailcheck plugin to check each one of them.


Configuration options
---------------------

The plugin is loaded by the taskbar at startup time by specifying a
"[plugin]" command in your .taskbarrc file (see the taskbar's README file
for more details), for example:

[plugin]
file = mailcheck.so

In addition, the following optional commands can be specified:

mailbox - specifies the mailbox file to monitor. The path may contain shell
    environment variable references (such as $HOME or $USER), which will be
    expanded to the appropiate values. Defaults to /var/spool/mail/$USER.

update_interval - specifies how often (in seconds) the mailbox should be
    checked for changes. Defaults to 30 seconds.

no_mail_icon - specifies the icon to be displayed if the mailbox is empty.
    Defaults to none (no icon displayed).

has_mail_icon - specifies the icon to be displayed if the mailbox is not
    empty, and contains no new and no unread messages. Defaults to a while
    envelope.

new_mail_icon - specifies the icon to be displayed if new mail has arrived.
    Defaults to a yellow envelope.

unread_mail_icon - specifies the icon to be displayed if the mailbox
    contains unread, but not new, messages. Defaults to a green envelope.

no_mail_tip - specifies the tooltip string to be displayed if the mailbox
    is empty. Defaults to "No mail".

has_mail_tip - specifies the tooltip string to be displayed if the mailbox
    is not empty and contains no new and no unread messages. Defaults to
    "You have mail".

new_mail_tip - specifies the tooltip string to be displayed if new mail
    has arrived. Defaults to "You have new mail".

unread_mail_tip - specifies the tooltip string to be displayed if the
    mailbox contains unread, but not new, messages. Defaults to "You have
    unread mail".

fvwm_action_click - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when the
    mail icon is clicked. Defaults to none.

fvwm_action_doubleclick - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when the
    mail icon is double-clicked. Defaults to none.

fvwm_action_new_mail - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when
    new mail arrives. Defaults to none.

All the specified icons must be valid xpm files, preferably 16x16 in size,
and must be located either in the xclass pixmap path, if the "icon_dir"
option was not specified in the "[default]" section of the .taskbarrc file,
or somewhere in the path specified by the "icon_dir" otherwise.


Example:

With the following configuration the computer will beep on arrival of new
mail, and a pine session in a xterm window will be started when the mail
icon is double-clicked:

[plugin]
file = mailcheck.so
mailbox = /var/spool/mail/$USER
fvwm_action_click = Nop
fvwm_action_doubleclick = Exec xterm -name Mail -T mail -e pine -i 
fvwm_action_new_mail = Beep
