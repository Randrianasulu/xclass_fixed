Intro
-----

This is a very simple plugin for the taskbar, it displays a user specified
icon in the tray window if some user specified file exists, and a different
icon (or no icon at all) otherwise. Or viceversa. Or, different icons can be
displayed depending whether the specified file exists or not. The plugin can
also execute an arbitrary fvwm95 command in response to a click and/or
double-click.

There can be many usages for this plugin, limited only to the imagination of
the user. It can be used, for example, to show a modem icon if the modem
lock file exists (i.e. the modem is active), and to hide the icon otherwise.
With a double-click a modem control program can be executed to allow the
user to stop the connection.

Similarly to the icon plugin, there may be any arbitraty number of lockfile
plugins loaded at a given moment, each one displaying a different icon and
associated to a different lock files.


Configuration options
---------------------

The plugin is loaded by the taskbar at startup time by specifying a
"[plugin]" command in your .taskbarrc file (see the taskbar's README file
for more details), for example:

[plugin]
file = lockfile.so

In addition, the following optional commands can be specified:

lockfile - specifies the path to the file to monitor for existence. The
    path may contain shell environment variable references (such as $HOME),
    which will be expanded to the appropiate values. 

icon_on - specifies the icon to be displayed if the lockfile file exists
    and defaults to none (no icon displayed).

icon_off - specifies the icon to be displayed if the lockfile file does not
    exist and defaults to none (no icon displayed).

icon - this an alias to the "icon_on" command.

tip_on - specifies the tooltip string to be displayed if the lockfile
    exists. If this option is not specifed, no tooltip will be displayed
    in that case.

tip_off - specifies the tooltip string to be displayed if the lockfile does
    not exist. If this option is not specifed, no tooltip will be displayed
    in that case.

tip - this is an alias to the "tip_on" option.

fvwm_action_click - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when the
    icon is clicked. Defaults to Nop.

fvwm_action_doubleclick - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when
    icon is double-clicked. Defaults to none.

All the specified icons must be valid xpm files, preferably 16x16 in size,
and must be located either in the xclass pixmap path, if the "icon_dir"
option was not specified in the "[default]" section of the .taskbarrc file,
or somewhere in the path specified by the "icon_dir" otherwise.


Example:

This shows an "connected" icon when the modem is in use. When clicked, a
"Network" popup menu will be displayed. You should have defined such menu
in your .fvwm95rc file.

[plugin]
file = lockfile.so
icon = mini-connect.xpm
tip = Modem is in use
fvwm_action_click = Popup Network
lockfile = /var/lock/LCK..modem
