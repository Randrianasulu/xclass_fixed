Intro
-----

This is a clock plugin for the taskbar, it displays the current time in the
tray window and the current date as a tooltip text.


Configuration options
---------------------

The plugin is loaded by the taskbar at startup time by specifying a
"[plugin]" command in your .taskbarrc file (see the taskbar's README file
for more details), for example:

[plugin]
file = clock.so

To make the clock appear as the rightmost item in the tray, this should be
the first "[plugin]" command to appear in the .taskbarrc file, before any
other similar "[plugin]" or "[swallow]" command.

In addition, the following optional commands can be specified:

time_format - specifies the time format string in a format adequate for the
    strftime function (for details consult the manual pages for the strftime
    function). The default value is "%H:%M", which displays the time in a
    24-hour format.

date_format - specifies the date format string in a format adequate for the
    strftime function (for details consult the manual pages for the strftime
    function). The default value is "%A, %B %d, %Y", which produces a date
    string like this: "Sunday, July 21, 2002".

fvwm_action_click - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when the
    clock is clicked. Defaults to none.

fvwm_action_doubleclick - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when
    clock is double-clicked. Defaults to none.


Examples:

The following sets the clock to 12-hour AM/PM format and displays a message
window showing the current date and time when the clock is clicked.

[plugin]
file = clock.so
time_format = %I:%M %p
fvwm_action_doubleclick = Exec xmessage `date`


As a note we should mention that the date and time format strings can be
interchanged, i.e, you can specify a date string for the "time_format"
option and viceversa. In that case the plugin will show the current date in
the tray window and the time will appear in a toopltip window when the mouse
cursor stops for a second or more over the displayed date. Alternatively,
you can have both the date and time displayed in the tray window with the
appropiate specification, for example:

time_format = %B %d, %Y - %I:%M %p
