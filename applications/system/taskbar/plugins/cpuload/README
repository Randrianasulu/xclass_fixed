Intro
-----

This is a "cpu load" plugin for the taskbar, it displays the cpu usage graph 
in the tray window.


Configuration options
---------------------

The plugin is loaded by the taskbar at startup time by specifying a
"[plugin]" command in your .taskbarrc file (see the taskbar's README file
for more details), for example:

[plugin]
file = cpuload.so

At this time no additional configuration options are supported. There is a
context menu which appears by clicking the right mouse button over the graph
window, but the only working options are "Clear", "SMP mode", and "Exit".
