Intro
-----

This is a battery-status plugin for the taskbar, useful for laptop
computers. It shows a small status icon in the tray window, which can be
one of the following:

- Blue battery: the computer's battery is fully charged.

- Half-blue battery: the battery is partially discharged.

- Gray battery with an exclamation mark next to it: the battery is almost
  completely discharged (this is the "alert" state).

- Gray battery with a red X in top of it: the battery is totally discharged.

- AC plug-in cord: the computer is working from mains power, the battery
  is not being charged.

- AC plug-in cord in front of a half-yellow battery: the computer is working
  from mains power and the battery is being charged.

- Yellow battery with a question mark: APM support is not enabled in your
  computer and therefore the battery status cannot be determined.

In addition, a tooltip text is displayed when the mouse cursor stops for a
second or more over the icon, showing the current status and battery power
level in percent.

The plugin also allows you to execute fvwm95 commands in response to
certain actions, like clicking and/or double-clicking the icon, or during
the "alert" status.

In order for this plugin to work, you should have enabled APM support in
your Linux kernel.


Configuration options
---------------------

The plugin is loaded by the taskbar at startup time by specifying a
"[plugin]" command in your .taskbarrc file (see the taskbar's README file
for more details), for example:

[plugin]
file = battstat.so

In addition, the following optional commands can be specified:

update_interval - specifies how often (in seconds) the plugin should check
    the battery status, and defaults to 30 seconds.

fvwm_action_click - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when the
    status icon is clicked. Defaults to none.

fvwm_action_doubleclick - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when
    the status icon is double-clicked. Defaults to none.

fvwm_action_alert - specifies the fvwm95 command to be executed when the
    "alert" status is entered. This command will be executed periodically,
    with the interval specified by the "update_interval" option (see above),
    which is by default every 30 secons, until the "alert" status finishes.


Examples:

This sets the update interval to 10 seconds, and beeps on alert every 10
seconds:

[plugin]
file = battstat.so
update_interval = 10
fvwm_action_alert = Beep


This one shows a message window every 30 seconds when the battery is low
and executes a 'control_panel' program when the icon is double-clicked:

[plugin]
file = battstat.so
fvwm_action_alert = Exec xmessage "Battery low! Save your data!"
fvwm_action_doubleclick = Exec control_panel
