Intro
-----

This is a very simple plugin for the taskbar, it displays a user specified
icon in the tray window and executes the user specified action in response
to a click and/or double-click.

There can be many usages for this plugin, limited only to the imagination of
the user. At the end of this file we show an example of how to configure it
to display a speaker icon that starts a mixer application when double-clicked.

Of course, you are not limited to running a singe icon plugin, there may
be any arbitraty number of icon plugins loaded at a given moment, each
one displaying a different icon and associated to different actions.


Configuration options
---------------------

The plugin is loaded by the taskbar at startup time by specifying a
"[plugin]" command in your .taskbarrc file (see the taskbar's README file
for more details), for example:

[plugin]
file = icon.so

In addition, the following optional commands can be specified:

icon - specifies the icon to be displayed and defaults to a question mark.
    The icon must be a valid xpm file, preferably 16x16 in size, and must
    be located either in the xclass pixmap path, if the "icon_dir" option
    was not specified in the "[default]" section of the .taskbarrc file,
    or somewhere in the path specified by the "icon_dir" otherwise.

tip - specifies the string to be displayed in the tooltip window when the
    mouse cursor stops over the icon for more than a second. If this
    option is not specifed, no tooltip will be displayed.

fvwm_action_click - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when the
    icon is clicked. Defaults to Nop.

fvwm_action_doubleclick - specifies the fvwm95 command to execute when
    icon is double-clicked. Defaults to none.


Example:

This shows an speaker icon and starts the xmix application in response to a
double-click:

[plugin]
file = icon.so
icon = mini-sound.xpm
tip = Mixer
fvwm_action_doubleclick = Exec xmix
