Here is the version 0.7 (beta) of XCDiff.

INTRO
-----

XCDiff is a frontend to the "diff" command. Differences of two ASCII files
are shown in different colors. All differences can be accessed through the
Next/Center/Prev buttons or a ListBox.

Changes are highlited in green and marked as "C" ('C'hanged). Lines that 
are present in the right file but not in the left are highlited in blue and
marked as "A" ('A'dded). Lines not present in the right file are drawn in
red and marked with a "D" ('D'eleted).

Binary files are not handled!!!


BUGS
----

- Sometimes the differences are not correctly shown
- And some unknown


TODO
----

- Smart update of the both Diff-Viewers
- Horizontal scroll of the view panes
- CVS revision diff
- Code cleanup
