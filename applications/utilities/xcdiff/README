Here is the version 0.6 (alpha) of XCDiff.

Many features missing and (I'm absolutly sure) there are bugs.

XCDiff is a frontend to the "diff" command. Differences of
two ASCII files are shown in different colors. All differences
can be accessed through the Next/Center/Prev buttons or a
ListBox.

Changes are drawn "green" and marked as "C". Lines added in
the right file are "blue" colored and marked as "A". Lines deleted
in the right file are drawn "red" and marked with a "D".

Binary files are not handled!!!

BUGS :
- Diff menu entries enable/disable is not correct
- Sometimes the differences are not correctly shown
- And some unknown

TODO :
- Save options
- Color stuff
- Smart update of the both Diff-Viewers
- CVS revision diff
- Code cleanup
