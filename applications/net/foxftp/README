Well, this is my approve to implement a FTP Client

Many things are missing and (I'm absolutly sure) there are numerous
bugs.

Most of the things are self-explanary ....... if not, find it out.
I have no time to write a full documentation.

BUGS:

TODO: 
- Open file with ...
- Open file with default action of mimetypes
- If a file is a link get correct size of file
- Implement copy/paste
- Implement stop button
- Implement all other missing features

- Drag'n drop would be very nice
- Lots of things ....
