Intro
-----

This the version 0.4.1 of fOXIrc, an irc client with a nice graphical user
interface.


Installation
------------

This version of fOXIrc requires xclass 0.7.4 or newer. To build the
executable, cd to the directory where you unpacked the sources and type
'make'. Copy the resulting 'foxirc' executable to a directory somewhere in
your $PATH.

foxircrc


Usage
-----

The fOXIrc user interface is very intuitive (I hope!). When you first start
the program, the "info" window will appear. Connection messages, server
notices, the MOTD and some other info are shown by default in that window.

Use the "IRC/Connect to..." menu option (or click on the "connect" toolbar
icon) to connect to a remote server. In the dialog box that appears fill in
the hostname, change the nick and/or irc name, then click "Connect". You
should see the connection details in the info window,




The program also recognizes a few of ircII-style commands, the following can
be typed on the channel window:

/me <action>
/notice <nick> <message>
/names -- works only for the current channel, refreshes the name list.
/leave
/msg <nick> [<message>]
/nick <newnick>
/raw <command>
/quote <command>
/wallops <message>
/mode <mode> [<mode arguments>]  -- note: the channel must not be specified,
                                    it works only for the current channel
/umode <usermode>
/whois <nick>
/whowas <nick>
/invite <nick>  -- like in /mode above, you do not have to specify the
                   channel name
/kick <nick>
/command --> sends command as raw, that way you can type such commands
             as /who, /silence, etc...
/ctcp <nick or channel> <command> <args>


Private chat (/msg) windows also recognize a few of these commands:

/me <action>
/notice <message>
/msg <nick> [<message>]
/raw <command>
/quote <command>
/whois <nick>
/whowas <nick>

DCC chat windows only recognize the /me command.


Enjoy it!
Hector.
