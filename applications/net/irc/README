Intro
-----

This the version 0.4.1 of fOXIrc, an irc client with a nice graphical 
(point-and-click) user interface.


Installation
------------

This version of fOXIrc requires xclass 0.7.4 or newer. To build the
executable, cd to the directory where you unpacked the sources and type
'make'. Copy the resulting 'foxirc' executable to a directory somewhere in
your $PATH.


Quick usage guide
-----------------

The fOXIrc user interface is very intuitive (I hope!). When you first start
the program, the "info" window will appear. Connection messages, server
notices, the MOTD and some other miscellaneous information are shown in that
window.

To connect to a server use the "IRC/Connect to..." menu option (or click on
the "connect" toolbar icon). In the dialog box that appears fill in the
hostname, port, set the nick and/or irc name, then click "Connect".

You can also setup a list of your prefered servers. Use the preferences
dialog ("Edit/Preferences..." from the menu or the little hammer toolbar
button), click on the "Servers" tab and add your servers. Next time you can
use the combo box at the top of the Connect dialog to select your favorite
server.

To join a channel, just type its name in the "Join" entry box below the
toolbar (do not forget the "#" symbol), and press Enter. If the channel
requires a key, just type the key after the channel name, separated by an
space (e.g. "#vipchannel secretkey").

Channel windows have a set of buttons with the nick names of the people
present in the channel. Channel operators and voiced users are marked by an
icon. Clicking on the buttons pops up a menu with which you can start a
private chat, change the user's mode (if you are a channel operator), start
a DCC chat or file send, send a CTCP command, etc.

Private messages appear on a separate window, which can be used to have a
separate, private chat.

All standard IRC text attributes (bold, underline and reverse video) are
supported, as well mIRC color extensions and ANSI color codes.

The output of any window (info, channel, private or DCC chat) can be sent
to a log file, each window can have its own separate log file. Since text
attributes and color codes are also sent to the log, I have included a
"Log/View..." option to view the saved log files (there is also a simple
C program included with this distribution, named mirc2ansi, which
translates color and text attributes into their approximate ANSI
equivalents, so that the file could be viewed by simply 'cat'-ing it
through mirc2ansi).

The program also recognizes a few of ircII-style commands, the following can
be typed on the channel window:

/me <action>                 - sends an action text to the channel
/notice <message>            - sends a notice to the channel
/names                       - works only for the current channel,
                               refreshes the name list (you won't see
                               any output).
/leave                       - leaves the channel
/msg <nick> [<message>]      - send a private message to the specified
                               user
/nick <newnick>              - change nicks
/raw <command>               - send the specified command to the server
/quote <command>             - same as /raw
/wallops <message>           - send a wallops message (works only if you
                               are an irc operator)
/mode <mode> [<arguments>]   - set or change channel mode (note that the
                               channel must not be specified, the command
                               works only for the current channel)
/umode <usermode>            - change user mode
/whois <nick>                - perform a WHOIS query on the specified nick
/whowas <nick>               - perfoerm a WHOWAS query
/invite <nick>               - invite a person to the current channel
                               (like in /mode above, you do not have to
                               specify the channel name)
/kick <nick>                 - kick nick from the channel
/<command>                   - this sends 'command' as raw, that way you
                               can type such commands as /who, /silence,
                               etc.
/ctcp <nick or channel> <command> <args> - send a CTCP command to the
                               specified nick or channel.

Private chat (message) windows also recognize a few of these commands:

/me <action>                 - sends an action text to the ohter party
/notice <message>            - sends a notice to the user
/msg <nick> [<message>]      - send a private message to another user
/raw <command>               - send the specified command to the server
/quote <command>             - same as /raw
/whois <nick>                - perform a WHOIS query on the specified nick
/whowas <nick>               - perfoerm a WHOWAS query

DCC chat windows only recognize the /me command.

The following features are not yet implemented:

- Ignores
- Notify
- Channel monitoring
- Channel encryption (CTCP SED)
- Auto-log
- DCC resume


Enjoy it!
