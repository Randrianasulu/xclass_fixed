25/07/02

- Started working on the latest code I could find (v0.03)


28/07/02

- Added an OXListView-based window to display channel lists.


07/08/02  (0.1)

- Handle channel mode changes properly: update menus and show the current
  mode in the status bar.


08/08/02

- OXPreferences: reworked the color setting code, changed the ini file
  structure a bit - all colors are now grouped together and there is no
  need for a color id.

- Removed OGC, using now xclass' OXGC instead.

- Added a font selection dialog, added the corresponding code to OLineDoc
  in order to handle font changes.

- Removed unused arguments from OTcpMessage.


09/08/02  (0.2)

- Rearranged nick menus, now they are created and maintained by the
  corresponding channel window.

- Corrected a problem with nick buttons pixmaps.

- Setting/removing user modes from the nick menu now works.

- OXConfirmDlg made more generic.

- Added accelerated scroll mode to OXViewDoc (I recall I've done that
  *long* ago, but the code had dissappeared?!?) and to the nick button
  list.


10/08/02

- OXIrc: menu code cleanup, use #defined names instead of a mess of fixed
  numbers.

- Removed OXTextFrame, as it had become practically nothing, all the needed
  functionality was on OXViewDocFrame (note: still I need to remove a couple
  of classes, since much of the functionality is implemented in xclass'
  OXView).

- Implemented more server menu actions.

- Added wheel-mouse support to OXViewDoc.


11/08/02

- Errors can now be displayed on message boxes.

- Channel notices are now displayed properly.

- Added preliminary support for SILENCE and ISON notifications.

- More code cleanups.

- Nick buttons can now display several pixmaps. Added preliminary support
  for friend and ignores.

- Process RPL_CHANNELMODEIS.


12/08/02

- Heavily changed the irc message processing. OIrcMessage now parses the
  incoming message into a set of fields, according to the IRC specification.
  That makes the message processing a *lot* easier and less error-prone.
  The previous sscanf-based method was way too cumbersome.

- Added support for more commands.


13/08/02

- Added OXViewLogFile, a log file viewer. Useful for browsing through the
  old saved files.

- Kick is now handled properly, auto-rejoin implemented.

- After issuing a JOIN command, delay showing the channel window and sending
  the MODE command until we get the JOIN confirmation.

- Away replies handled.


14/08/02  (0.3)

- Added a ping timer, and lag time calculation.

- Corrected a bug that caused accented characters (code > 127) to dissapear.


15/08/02

- Added server pattern dialog for the server commands.

- Added support for ANSI color escape sequences.

- Fixed DCC file receive.


16/08/02  (0.4.1)

- Added menus to OXMsgChannel and OXDCCChannel.


18/08/02

- Fixed OXChannel's text entry history.

- OXChatChannel: implemented Invite menu option.

- Added more toolbar buttons.

- Added login/password dialog for the OPER command.

- Implemented Ban and Ban+Kick from the name list menu.


19/08/02

- Dropped TDDList in favour of STL's vector.

- Added a tree view window for the LINKS command.


20/08/02

- Added KILL command processing.

- Corrected a bug in OTcp.cc: the input buffer index should be reset to zero
  after a (re)connect. Also, check for closed connection on Receive()
  (reentrancy case -- we should really implement an OXClient message queue!)


21/08/02

- Added description group frame and connect/close buttons to OXServerTree.

- Added join/filter/close buttons to OXChannelList.

- Calculate lag only from the PONG commands we requested, any other should
  go to info.


22/08/02  (0.4.2)

- CTCP and DCC code moved to OXIrc. Added CTCP TIME, ERRMSG and CLIENTINFO
  command help.

- Added a command dialog. Used to get CTCP/Other... command and arguments.

- Added /ctcp command to OXChatChannel.


23/08/02

- OXMsgChannel.cc: menu is now (partially) processed.

- Fixed a bug in OTcp::Connect(): now returns -1 if the connection failed.

- Moved logfile handling from OXChatChannel to OXChannel, that way
  OXMsgChannel and OXDCCChannel can save the chat to a log too.


24/08/02

- Implemented DCC SEND.

- OXDCCFile transfer windows are now in a list handled by OXIrc, much like
  OXChannel, so they can all be closed at exit.

- Added support for channel key handling.


25/08/02

- Channel dialogs can now use a different font, but only the info window
  font is saved and used as default.


16/09/04  (0.4.4)

- Removed an endless loop problem in OXDCCFile (happened in client mode when
  the server prematurely closed the connection).


22/09/04  (0.5.1)

- Corrected the DCC File transfer protocol.

- Added a help window and a few preliminary help files.
